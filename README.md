# Machine Learning — Course Repository

This repository organizes course materials, assignments, experiments, and notes for the Machine Learning course (semester 8). It is a private local workspace and is not published to GitHub.

Structure
- assignments/      — graded assignments and problem sets (one folder per assignment)
- labs/             — lab notebooks and practical exercises
- projects/         — course projects and final reports
- datasets/         — cleaned copies or pointers to datasets used
- notebooks/        — exploratory analysis and experiments (Jupyter notebooks)
- scripts/          — reusable scripts and utilities
- reports/          — write-ups, PDFs, and presentation slides

Guidelines
- Use clear folder names: `assignment-01`, `project-name`, etc.
- Include a short README in each major folder describing contents and how to run code.
- Keep datasets under `datasets/` and add metadata or a README explaining sources and preprocessing.
- Use virtual environments and record dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).

Notes
- This repo is intended for coursework only and will remain private.
- Back up important work regularly.
